## NPYPD Shooting Data Analysis

SQL is the lingua franca of Data Analysis and as such everyone Data Analyst must learn to love and work with SQL. But lets say you love R because its awesome and so want to work in Rstudio; supercool IDE for data professionals. Fortunately, there is a way to work with SQL in R. Yes! you can manipulate dataframes in R using pure, unadulterated SQL. How cool is that?

In this article we will use SQL to query R dataframes. We will use the `sqldf` package to accomplish our goal.

### Ask
 Lets try to find answers to the following questions
 
 1. How many rows are in the dataset?
 2. What is the count of victims and perpetrators?
 3. Which precinct had the highest crimes?

### Prepare 

The dataset contains every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 to end of year(2020). The data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/guecoraph/nypd-shooting-history).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(pacman)

p_load(readr, stringr, lubridate, dplyr, sqldf, skimr, psych, janitor, DBI, dbplyr)
```

```{r}
nypd <- read_csv("NYPD Shooting Incident - Data 2006-2021.csv")
skim(nypd) # lets get to know our data

# View(nypd)
```
The `skim` function from the `skimr` provide an easy way to get valuable metadata. Information like data types and stats is invaluable in your analysis.


### Process

```{r}
# let's clean up column names a bit
nypd <- clean_names(nypd)
colnames(nypd)
```

```{r}
# look at the data structure
glimpse(nypd)
```


Lets get some statistics on the numeric columns.

```{r}
nypd %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  describe()
```

Now lets see the power of the `sqldf` package for querying our data

```{r}

nypd <- nypd %>% 
  mutate(occur_time = as.POSIXct(occur_time), 
         incident_key = as.numeric(incident_key),
         occur_date = as.Date(occur_date,  "%m/%d/%Y"))
 
class(nypd$occur_time) 
```

```{r}
# get only the time from the date
nypd$occur_time <- nypd$occur_time %>% 
  format(format = "%H:%M:%S")
```


Now lets start using SQL to make some queries

```{r}
# select the first 10  rows from my df

sqldf("SELECT * FROM nypd LIMIT 10")
```
find the number of rows

```{r}

sqldf("select count(*) as num_rows from nypd")
```

select where all female victims

```{r}
sqldf("select 
      precinct, 
      vic_race, 
      vic_sex 
      from nypd 
      where vic_sex == 'F' limit 10")
```

```{r}
# count the number of rows where the victim is  Black
sqldf("select count(*) from nypd where vic_race == 'BLACK'")
```

count the number of rows where the perpetrator is  Black
```{r}
 
sqldf("select count(*) from nypd where perp_race == 'BLACK'")
```


```{r}
# count the number of rows where the victim is a White Hispanic
sqldf("select count(*) from nypd where vic_race == 'WHITE HISPANIC'")
```

```{r}
# count groups by victim's sex
sqldf("select 
      boro,
      precinct,
      vic_sex,
      count(vic_sex) as count_vic_sex
      
      from nypd
      group by vic_sex
      
      ")
```


count distinct race of victims

```{r}
sqldf("select 
      distinct(vic_race) as distinct_race
      from nypd"
      )
```

```{r}
# group by race and find count of perps and vics by race
sqldf("select 
      perp_race, 
      vic_race,
      count(vic_race) as vic_count,
      count(perp_race) as perp_count
      from nypd
      group by vic_race
      ")
```


```{r}
sqldf("select 
      vic_race, 
      precinct,
      count(precinct) as precinct_count
      from nypd
      group by precinct, vic_race
      limit 10
      ")
```


```{r}


# number of precinct
sqldf("select 
      count(distinct(precinct) ) as number_of_precinct
      from nypd
      ")

```




Isn't this cool? I think its great!

Clearly, there is more you can do with this package. I look forward to using this more in my work. I hope you will too.

Happy Analyzing!!
