Data Analysis is a process of collecting, organizing, and transforming raw data to derive insight for decision-making. Every organization on this planet has data and as such needs Data Analysts; people who perform the task of data analysis. 

I recently enrolled in the Google Professional Data Analyst Certificate where I learned the phases Data Analyst go through when performing their duties.

In this article, I will share these phases or recipes that all great Data Analysts follow;

### Ask 

In this phase you do the following that helps set the pace for the other phase;

You clearly define the business problem to be solved
You also clearly define all stakeholder needs or requirements.

To excel in this phase you need to ask SMART questions. What are SMART questions? These are question that has the following attributes;

Specific<br/>
Measurable<br/>
Achievable <br/>
Relevant <br/>
Time-bound.

### Prepare
The Prepare phase involves collecting and storing the data you will need for your analysis. It involves defining the key attribute of your data, potential problems in it, and how it's organized.

### Process 
In this, the Data Analyst cleans, format, and rid the data of any inconsistencies and biases. Clean data makes analysis a breeze. The is where the bulk of the work lives. It is important that your data is cleaned and formatted right if your analysis will be accurate.

### Analyze
In this, you transform, organize and then analyze the data to uncover the hidden trends and relationships in the data while trying to find answers to the questions from the Ask phase.

### Share 
The Share phase involves interpreting and sharing your analysis with stakeholders to help them make informed decisions. That usually means creating compelling visualizations that you can share with stakeholders. Tools like Python, R, Tableau, and even Spreadsheet are used.

### Act
The final phase of the Data Analysis process involves using insight from your visualization to generate recommendations that will guide informed decision-making. 

Following all these steps makes a great Data Analyst. That is why I intend to use them daily when performing data analysis. My subsequent articles will use these steps in case studies.
