Web scraping is the act of extracting data from web pages. It is one of the best ways of getting data from from a website. You can get data from web elements like tables, divs, etc. with web scraping. 

Note, that you may need to get permission or find out if a website allows scraping before doing so from a `robots.txt` file on a website. Fortunately, the R `robotstxt` package can help us find out this important information.

## How does it Work

To scrape data from a website you need a working knowledge of `HTML` and `CSS`. These together with `JavaScript` are the lingua franca of the web. A good understanding of `HMTL` tags `CSS` selectors like class, ids, etc will help you when scrapping a website.

In this article, we will scrap [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/)'s top rated movies. We will focus on the movie's title, year, rank and rating. Let's get started.


```{r}
# load the libraries
# pacman enable to easily load multiple packages at a time
library(pacman)

p_load(rvest, dplyr, ggplot2, robotstxt, stringr, ggthemes)
```

Check if the website can be scrapped.

```{r}
paths_allowed("https://www.imdb.com/chart/top") # yes we can
```

We will scrap top movies title, year, rating and then analyze it.

```{r}
url = "https://www.imdb.com/chart/top"

top_movies <- read_html(url) 
  
```

### Get all title

```{r}
# get all the titles
movie_title <- top_movies %>% 
  html_nodes(".titleColumn a") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  as.vector()
```


### Get all year

```{r}
# get all the year
year <- top_movies %>% 
  html_nodes("span.secondaryInfo") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  str_replace_all("\\(|\\)", "") %>% 
  as.integer()

head(year)
typeof(year)
```

### Get all rating
```{r}
# get all rating
rating <- top_movies %>% 
  html_nodes(".ratingColumn strong") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  as.numeric() 
```

### Get all rank

Lets get the ranks as well

```{r}
rank <- top_movies %>% 
  html_nodes("td.titleColumn") %>% 
  html_text2() %>% 
  str_split(" ") %>% 
  lapply(., function(movie){
    movie[1]
  }) %>% 
  str_replace_all("\\.", "") %>% 
  as.integer()
  
```


### Create a `tibble`

Now lets combine all to create a tibble.

```{r}
movie_tibble <- tibble(
  title = movie_title,
  year = year,
  rating = rating, 
  rank = rank
)

head(movie_tibble)
#View(movie_tibble)
```
And just like that, we have successfully scrapped top movie title, year, rating and rank. Let's write our new data to a `csv` file for further analysis.

```{r}

write.csv(movie_tibble, "imdb_top_movies.csv")
```


Now that we have a clean dataset, we can start with our analysis. To do that we need to following the data [analysis process](http://localhost:6540/p/data-analysis-process/).


## Ask 

The following questions will guide our analysis;

1. Which movie was ranked the highest?
2. Which year were those movies?
3. Which movies made the top 10 list?


## Prepare

Our dataset is [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/)'s top rated movies.


## Prepare 

The data has the following structure;

```{r}
glimpse(movie_tibble)
```

### Visualization

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=16, fig.height=10}
# year <- as.Date(as.character(data_file$evtYear), format = "%Y")

g <- movie_tibble %>% 
  select(title, rating) %>% 
  top_n(10, rating) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(title, rating), y=rating)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=title, )) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = factor(rating)), vjust = 1.5, hjust=1.4, colour = "white") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Top 10 Rated movies",
      x="Movie Title",
      y="Movie Rank")

g + scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=16, fig.height=10}
# year <- as.Date(as.character(data_file$evtYear), format = "%Y")

g <- movie_tibble %>% 
  select(title, rating, year) %>% 
  top_n(10, rating) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(title, rating), y=rating)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill=title)) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = factor(year)), vjust = 1.5, hjust=1.4, colour = "white") +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Top 10 rated movies and the year of production",
      x="Movie Title",
      y="Movie Rank")

g + scale_fill_calc() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```


In this article, we scraped data from IMDB website, clean it and visualized it to answer some questions. These are some of the things Data Professional do in real world. I hope this will be a guide for you in your data journey. In subsequent articles I will build a dashboard from the data we scraped here.

:) Happy Analyzing!
