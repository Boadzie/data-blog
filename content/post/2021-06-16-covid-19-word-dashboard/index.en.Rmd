Ever wanted to make a dashboard, maybe to visualize some KPI or visualize COVID-19 statistics? There some many ways to build a dashboard. You can use Business Intelligence tools like tableau, looker or Google Data Studio. These dashboards offer the following advantages;

1. They can show live data that can be updated automatically(That is what we will build in this tutorial).

2. They can allow for up-to-date filtering and viewing of data.

3. Make timely informed-decision making possible.


In, this article we will build a live dashboard connected to live data. The dashboard will show COVID-19  updates globally.


We will build the dashboard with Data Studio with data scraped from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

First, we will use Google Sheet to scrape the data from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). To scrape data with Google Sheets, do the following;

1. Copy the [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) url.

2. open a new empty sheet

3. Type the following code into the first cell and press enter

```
=IMPORTHTML("https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/", "table", 1)
```

The formula has the following arguments;


> IMPORTHTML(url, query, index)
>
>url - The URL of the page to examine, including protocol (e.g. http://).
The value for url must either be enclosed in quotation marks or be a  reference to a cell containing the appropriate text.
>
>query - Either "list" or "table" depending on what type of structure 
contains the desired data.
>
>index - The index, starting at 1, which identifies which table or list as 
defined in the HTML source should be returned. 
The indices for lists and tables are maintained separately, so there may
be both a list and a table with index 1 if both types of elements exist on the HTML page.
>       
>(from Google)
`

The output should look like the following;

![COVID Data](./scrape_data.png?width=14)

We now use this data in Google Data Studio to build the dashboard below. The dashboard will automately update every 15 minutes. Cool right? I know!!

With BI tools like Google Data Studio, telling stories in data is a breeze. I hope this will inspire to try it out on your own.

Happy Analyzing!!
